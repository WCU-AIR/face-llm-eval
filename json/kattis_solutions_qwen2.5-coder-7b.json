      "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a binary user (who can only move in regions marked with '0') and a decimal user (who can only move in regions marked with '1') can travel between two specified locations on the map. We'll use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the possible paths for both users.\n\nHere's the Python program:\n\n```python\ndef dfs(grid, start_r, start_c, end_r, end_c):\n    n = len(grid)\n    m = len(grid[0])\n    \n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 \u003C= r \u003C n and 0 \u003C= c \u003C m\n    \n    stack = [(start_r, start_c)]\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while stack:\n        current_r, current_c = stack.pop()\n        \n        if (current_r, current_c) in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add((current_r, current_c))\n        \n        if (current_r, current_c) == (end_r, end_c):\n            return True\n        \n        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n            new_r, new_c = current_r + dr, current_c + dc\n            if is_valid(new_r, new_c) and grid[new_r][new_c] == grid[start_r][start_c]:\n                stack.append((new_r, new_c))\n    \n    return False\n\ndef binary_decimal_travel(grid, queries):\n    results = []\n    \n    for r1, c1, r2, c2 in queries:\n        if dfs(grid, r1-1, c1-1, r2-1, c2-1):\n            results.append('binary' if grid[r1-1][c1-1] == '0' else 'decimal')\n        else:\n            results.append('neither')\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nr, c = map(int, input().split())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(r)]\nn = int(input())\nqueries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Process and output results\nresults = binary_decimal_travel(grid, queries)\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **DFS Function**:\n   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the map from a starting point `(start_r, start_c)` to an ending point `(end_r, end_c)`.\n   - It uses a stack for DFS and ensures that only valid moves are made (north, south, east, west).\n   - It checks if the current cell is already visited to avoid cycles.\n   - If the current cell matches the grid value of the starting cell, it continues the search.\n\n2. **Binary-Decimal Travel Function**:\n   - The `binary_decimal_travel` function processes each query and determines if a binary or decimal user can travel between the specified locations.\n   - It calls the `dfs` function for each query and appends the appropriate result ('binary', 'decimal', or 'neither') to the results list.\n\n3. **Input Handling**:\n   - The input is read line by line, parsing the dimensions of the grid, the grid itself, and the queries.\n   - The coordinates are adjusted by subtracting 1 because Python uses zero-based indexing.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - The program outputs the results for each query as specified.\n\nThis solution ensures that both users' travel constraints are respected and efficiently checks connectivity using DFS."

The game logic is implemented inside this function. We use a set called `visited` to keep track of squares the frog has already visited to detect cycles.\n\nThe main loop continues until the frog either lands on a square containing the magic number, falls off the board, or enters a cycle. Depending on these conditions, the program prints the corresponding fate and the number of hops made. The initial values for `current_position` and `hop_count` are set based on the input parameters.\n\nThe input is read from standard input using the `input()` function, which reads a line as a string. The `map(int, ...)` functions convert these strings to integers, and `split()` breaks the line into words separated by spaces.\n\nYou can test this program with the provided sample inputs."
